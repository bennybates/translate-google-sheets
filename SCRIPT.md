[Introduction]
Hello and welcome to the demonstration of the Translate Google Sheets app. In this video, we will showcase how the app utilizes the required scopes to enhance the user experience and provide powerful functionality within Google Sheets. This demonstration is specifically for Google's review purposes.

[Scope: Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications]
One of the scopes required by Translate Google Sheets is the ability to display and run third-party web content within prompts and sidebars inside Google applications. This scope enables us to create a seamless integration of our app directly within Google Sheets, making it easier for users to access translation features without leaving their spreadsheet.

[Demo: Displaying Translation Sidebar]
In this demo, we will show you how the Translate Google Sheets app displays a translation sidebar within Google Sheets. By selecting the desired cells and opening the app's sidebar, users can conveniently translate the content without the need for external tools or applications.

[Scope: Allow this application to run when you are not present]
Translate Google Sheets also requires the scope to run when you are not present. This allows the app to continue processing translations even when you are not actively using Google Sheets. It ensures that translations are accurate and up-to-date, saving you time and effort.

[Demo: Automatic Translation Processing]
Let's see this scope in action. As you can see, even when I'm not actively interacting with the app, it continues to process translations in the background. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with large spreadsheets or when you need translations to be performed on a scheduled basis.

[Scope: Connect to an external service]
Translate Google Sheets also utilizes the scope to connect to an external service. This enables the app to establish a secure connection with our translation service provider, ensuring accurate and reliable translations.

[Demo: Seamless External Service Integration]
In this demo, we will demonstrate the seamless integration of the external translation service. By leveraging this scope, Translate Google Sheets can provide high-quality translations based on the selected source and target languages. The app communicates with the external service to retrieve translations quickly and efficiently.

[Conclusion]
